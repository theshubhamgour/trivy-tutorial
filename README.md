## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Docker
- Basic Linux commands
- Trivy installed

```bash
trivy --version
```

---

## 🔍 Common Trivy Commands

### Scan Docker Image
```bash
trivy image nginx:latest
```

### Scan Local Filesystem
```bash
trivy fs .
```

### Secret Scanning Only
```bash
trivy fs --scanners secret .
```

### Scan Git Repository
```bash
trivy repo https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
```

### Generate SBOM
```bash
trivy image --format cyclonedx nginx:latest
```

## 🤖 Automation (Real DevSecOps Use Case)

This repo includes **shell scripts** to automate daily security scans, commonly used with:
- Cron jobs
- CI/CD pipelines
- Pre-commit hooks

Automation ensures security is **continuous, not manual**.

---

## 🏢 Enterprise / Production Concepts

- Trivy Server Mode (centralized scanning)
- Reduced DB downloads
- Faster CI/CD pipelines
- Ideal for large-scale DevSecOps teams
