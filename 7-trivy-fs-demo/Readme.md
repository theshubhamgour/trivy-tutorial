# Trivy Secret Scanning – Sample Secrets Demo (Safe for Testing)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**  
All examples in this repository are **FAKE / DUMMY secrets** created **only for learning, demos, and Trivy scans**.  
❌ Do NOT use real credentials here  
❌ Do NOT commit real secrets to GitHub

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This README

This README helps you understand:
- What **secret types** Trivy can detect
- How secrets **look in real projects**
- Why committing them is dangerous
- How Trivy flags them during secret scanning

This is commonly used for:
- DevSecOps demos  
- Training videos  
- CI/CD security testing  
- Learning Trivy secret detection

---

## 🔑 AWS Access Keys (Sample)

```text
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

**Why risky**
- Grants direct access to AWS resources
- Can lead to cloud takeover if leaked

**How Trivy detects**
- Known AWS key patterns

---

## 🐙 GitHub Personal Access Token (Sample)

```text
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234
```

**Why risky**
- Allows repo access, code push, secret reading

**How Trivy detects**
- GitHub token prefix patterns (`ghp_`, `github_pat_`)

---

## 🔐 Generic Password (Sample)

```text
DB_PASSWORD=SuperSecurePassword123!
```

**Why risky**
- Often reused across environments
- Easy target for brute-force or leaks

**How Trivy detects**
- Common variable name patterns (`PASSWORD`, `PASS`, `PWD`)

---

## 🗝️ Private Key (SSH / RSA – Sample)

```text
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEowIBAAKCAQEAuFakeKeyExampleOnlyDontUseInProd
s7C3a1xExampleKeyMaterialOnly
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

**Why risky**
- Direct server or Git access
- Full compromise if exposed

**How Trivy detects**
- PEM / key block signatures

---

## 🎯 High-Entropy Strings (JWT Secret Sample)

```text
JWT_SECRET=YWRtaW5TdXBlclNlY3JldEtleTEyMzQ1NiEhIQ==
```

or

```text
JWT_SECRET=KJH#9a$2!FJd93k@LQw9s0XzPpVb
```

**Why risky**
- Used to sign authentication tokens
- Can allow auth bypass

**How Trivy detects**
- Entropy-based detection (random-looking strings)

---

## 🔍 How to Scan Secrets Using Trivy

```bash
trivy fs --scanners secret .
```

Or include vulnerabilities + secrets:

```bash
trivy fs .
```

---

## 📊 Typical Trivy Output (What You’ll See)

- Secret type (AWS, GitHub, Private Key)
- File path
- Line number
- Severity
- Detection rule used

---

## 🧠 Real-World Usage

In real DevSecOps pipelines, secret scanning is used to:
- Block PRs with leaked secrets
- Scan repositories before deployment
- Enforce compliance & security policies
- Protect cloud & production systems

---

## ✅ Best Practices (Production)

✔ Use environment variables  
✔ Store secrets in:
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Vault
- Azure Key Vault
✔ Rotate leaked secrets immediately  
❌ Never hardcode secrets  

---

## 📌 Final Note

> “These examples exist **only to demonstrate Trivy secret detection**.  
Real secrets should **never** appear in source code or version control.”

---

🚀 Happy Secure Scanning!
